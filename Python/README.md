### What is Python?
***
In short,
>Python is a high-level, interpreted general purpose programming language. It's lack of massive verbosity (like Java)
> gives it increased productivity.


### Why use Python?
***
- It's object oriented
- For making prototypes of future projects
- For networking projects (3L1TE HAXX0R tools)
- It's incredibly popular
- It's very beginner friendly
- For various [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) projects
- No need to compile (it's interpreted)



### When not to use Python
***
- For performance-critical projects
- Low level programming (eg: Kernel code)
- Safety critical apps
- Graphically intensive programs (Video Games)
- Embedded programming
- Compilers

### Data types
***
- _boolean_:    

>the type of the built-in values True and False. Useful in conditional expressions, and anywhere else you want to represent the truth or falsity of some condition. Mostly interchangeable with the integers 1 and 0. In fact, conditional expressions will accept values of any type, treating special ones like boolean False, integer 0 and the empty string "" as equivalent to False, and all other values as equivalent to True. But for safetyâ€™s sake, it is best to only use boolean values in these places.


- _Numeric types_:

>int: Integers; equivalent to C longs in Python 2.x, non-limited length in Python 3.x

>long: Long integers of non-limited length; exists only in Python 2.x

>float: Floating-Point numbers, equivalent to C doubles

>complex: Complex Numbers

- _Sequences_:

>str: String; represented as a sequence of 8-bit characters in Python 2.x, but as a sequence of Unicode characters (in the range of U+0000 - U+10FFFF) in Python 3.x
bytes: a sequence of integers in the range of 0-255; only available in Python 3.x
byte array: like bytes, but mutable (see below); only available in Python 3.x

>list

>tuple

- _Sets_:

>set: an unordered collection of unique objects; available as a standard type since Python 2.6
frozen set: like set, but immutable (see below); available as a standard type since Python 2.6
Mappings:

> dict: Python dictionaries, also called hashmaps or associative arrays, which means that an element of the list is associated with a definition, rather like a Map in Java

### Basic Operators
***
##### _Arithmatic Operators_

_assume `a` is 10 and `b` is 20_

| Operator      | Description   | Example  |
| :-------------:|:-------------:|:---------:|
| `+` Addition      | Adds values on either side of the operator | `a + b = 30` |
| `-` Subtraction      | Subtracts the right hand operand from left hand operand| `a - b = -10` |
| `*` Multiplication | Multiplies the value on either side of the operator      | `a * b = 200` |
|`/` Division | Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand | `a / b = 2` |
|`%` Modulus | Divides the left hand operand by the right hand operand and return the remainder | `b % a = 0` |
| `**` Exponent |Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators | `a ** b` = `a to the power of b`
|`//` Floor Division | [Explanation from Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/183853/in-python-what-is-the-difference-between-and-when-used-for-division) | `9//2 = 4` and `9.0//2.0 = 4.0`|

##### _Assignment Operators_

| Operator    | Description   | Example  |
| :----------:| :------------:| :-------:|
| `=`         |	Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand | `c = a + b` assigns the value of `a + b` to `c`|
| `+=` Add AND | It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand | `c += a` is equivalent to `c = c + a`
| `-=` Subtract AND | It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand | `c -= a` is equivalent to `c = c - a`|
|`*=` Multiply AND | It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand | `c *= a` is equivalent to `c = c * a`|
| `/=` Divide AND | It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand | `c /= a` is equivalent to `c = c / a`
| `%=` Modulus AND | It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand | `c %= a` is equivalent to `c = c % a`
| `**=` Exponent AND | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand | `c **= a` is equivalent to `c = c ** a`|


### Advanced Operators
***
Each of these operators could have their own Wikipedia article, but for time/space purposes, [Here is a great chart from Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)

### Hello, Python!
***
Here is the most basic program you can write in Python:

```python          
          print("Hello, Python!")
```
This prints `Hello, Python!` to the console.

# Syntax
***
- `if, else, elif` loops

```python
if x == y:
  #do stuff
elif x == z:
  #do something else
else:
  #do this

```
- Functions

```python
def func_name(args):
  #do stuff

#run func_name
func_name(args)

```
