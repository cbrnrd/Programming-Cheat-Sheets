### What is Java?
***
Java is a high-level, verbose programming language that is developed by Oracle.

Some of its distinguished features are:

1. It runs on every platform
2. It is architecture-neutral
3. It is [object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
4. Java programs run in its own virtual sandbos (the JVM)

### Why use Java?
***
1. Excellent tooling: IDE, CI, etc.
2. Vast array of 3rd party libraries.
3. Huge amount of documentation available.
4. Large pool of developers available.
5. Platform ubiquitous.
6. Excellent performance.
7. Excellent specification.
8. Sturdy garbage collection.
9. Managed memory.
10. Native threads.
11. Choice - implemented by multiple vendors.
12. It is essentially the _common language_ of the programming industry

###When _not_ to use Java
***
1. Applications that are entirely bound by CPU time and need to be as fast as possible (should be written in C++)
2. Fast language processors like compilers and interpreters
3. Where implimentations using a virtual machines would not work well, like database engines
4. Applications that have to directly communicate with the hardware (OPERATING SYSTEMS. DON'T USE JAVA IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE AN OS)
